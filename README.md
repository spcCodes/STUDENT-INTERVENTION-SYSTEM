# STUDENT-INTERVENTION-SYSTEM
The goal of this project is to identify the students who might need intervention before they fail in the exams.
It is a classification problem as it contains binary output as whether the student needs intervention or not. 
The student data is saved as student-data.csv file.


The entire project has been explained in detail in the python notebook StudentInterventionSystem.ipynb

Dataset used: UCI Language : Python Packages : sklearn , matplotlib
